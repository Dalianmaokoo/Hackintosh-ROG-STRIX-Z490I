# Hackintosh-ROG-STRIX-Z490I

This repository is about hackintosh on **Asus ROG STRIZX Z490I**. 

**The project is not completely finished yet and a lot of functional test need to be done**, I'v done the basic installation, still working on it since it's not perfect yet. I'm no expert in hackintosh, and I'm not gonna to put plenty of extra SSDTs and kexts from other repos to make the system looks like everything is fine, so this project won't be finished so fast, if someone is interested in this project, your're welcomed to join me.

Anyone has the same board can use the EFI folder directly except the `EFI/OC/config.plist` file, you should generate your own SMBIOS info by following the [Comet Lake Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/config.plist/comet-lake.html#platforminfo). Highly recommended reading the whole [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/) before start, and try to build step by step yourself.

## Details

### GPU

#### iGPU Intel UHD630

HDMI display output is working fine, didn't test DP yet since I don't have a DP cable.

DeviceProperties: 

```xml
<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)</key>
<dict>
    <key>AAPL,ig-platform-id</key>
    <data>BwCbPg==</data>
    <key>framebuffer-patch-enable</key>

    <data>AAAAQA==</data>
    <key>device-id</key>
    <data>mz4AAA==</data>
</dict>
```

#### dGPU AMD Radeon VII

Natively supported, no additional configuration.

### Audio

Working by:

* AppleALC.kext
* FakePCIID.kext
* FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext
* device-id=`709D0000`
* layout-id=7

DeviceProperties: 

```xml
<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3)</key>
<dict>
    <key>layout-id</key>
    <integer>7</integer>
    <key>device-id</key>
    <data>cJ0AAA==</data>
</dict>
```

### Ethernet 

Working by:

* FakePCIID.kext
* FakePCIID_Intel_I225-V.kext
* device-id=`F2150000`

DeviceProperties: 

```xml
<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)</key>
<dict>
    <key>device-id</key>
    <data>8hUAAA==</data>
</dict>
```

`FakePCIID_Intel_I225-V.kext` is from **SchmockLord**'s repository, details in issue [2.5Gbit Ethernet (Intel I225-V) Don't work #8](https://github.com/SchmockLord/Hackintosh-Intel-i9-10900k-Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-D/issues/8).

### Wi-Fi/BT

Working by using a m.2 B+M-Key adapter with Apple Airport Card BCM94360CS. It's natively supported, airdrop, handoff and sidecar are working perfectly.

The onboard wireless network card Intel AX201NGW uses m.2 E-Key slot and CNVi protocol. I tried replace it with a m.2 A-Key BCM94352Z card, the slot is compatible but it didn't work even in windows, thanks to the CNVi thing ðŸ˜“. At last, I used a m.2 B+M-Key adapter with Apple Airport Card BCM94360CS, Wi-Fi/BT is working perfect now. Sadly, I have to give up a m.2 slot for SSD and the onboard ssd heat sink, while now I have two wireless network cards, one for macOS and one for windows.

The bluetooth can not be recognized by default, because it uses an onboard USB2.0 port for power supply, so USB mapping should be fixed first.

### USB

Rear panel USB works perfect now, and the 9-pin onboard USB2.0 which blutooth uses is ok too. Details on the way...

### BIOS

Version: 0607

### EFI

#### SSDTs

Compiled by following the [ACPI Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/), the `.dls` SSDT files can be found in SSDTS folder. According to the guide, SSDT-PMC is used for NVRAM support, but desktop Z490 boards **DO NOT** need it, so it's not included in ACPI.

* SSDT-EC-USBX.aml
